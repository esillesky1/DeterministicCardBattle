## üéØ Overview



Deterministic Card Battle is a **turn-based strategy card game** where two players summon units to a shared battlefield and compete to reduce the opponent's HP to zero.

The game emphasizes **resource management**, **strategic deployment**, and **predictable combat resolution** ‚Äî there's no randomness once the cards are played.

## üß± Core Concepts



* **Players:** Two players, each start with 100 HP.

* **Decks:** Each player uses a 20-card deck containing various unit types.

* **Units:** Each card has attributes: HP (health), Attack (damage), Speed (attack order), and Cost (mana required to summon).

## ü™Ñ Turn Structure



Each game consists of repeated turns until one player's HP reaches zero. Each turn has four phases:



1. **Deployment Phase** ‚Äî Players summon units from the top of their deck using available mana until they do not have enough to play the next card (up to 5 on the field).

2. **Combat Preparation Phase** ‚Äî Each unit's effective attack and speed are recalculated, including bonuses.

3. **Combat Phase** ‚Äî Units with a higher speed attack first in order. If there's a tie, order is randomized slightly. Units defeated during combat are removed from the board immediately.

4. **Cleanup Phase** ‚Äî Each player gains +1 mana.

## üéØ Targeting Logic



| Strategy            | Behavior                                                                                              |

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Optimize Damage** | Attacks the target whose remaining HP is closest to the unit's attack damage.                         |

| **Kill Shot**       | Prioritizes killing blows; attacks the highest HP enemy if no kill is possible.                       |

| **Target Mana**     | Prioritizes the highest-cost enemy unit; if there is a tie, target the tied unit with the highest HP. |

## üíé Flavors (Unit Variants)



Each card can have a **flavor** modifier that adjusts its stats:



| Flavor     | Effect      | Description             |

| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |

| **Speedy** | +6 Speed    | Acts faster each round. |

| **Hardy**  | +21% HP     | More survivable.        |

| **Angry**  | +20% Attack | Stronger offense.       |
